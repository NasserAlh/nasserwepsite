    <title>Audit Charter Amending Plan</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1><strong>Audit Charter Amending Plan</strong></h1>
	<p>Addressing the CEO's power to override the appraisal and evaluation ratings of internal auditors in the audit charter is crucial in reinforcing the independence and objectivity of the Internal Audit (IA) function within your organization. This measure can also help clarify the roles and responsibilities of the IA department, thereby reducing confusion among auditors about how to approach their assignments, particularly when these involve sensitive issues or potential conflicts with senior management.</p>

	<h2><strong>Steps To Address the Issue Effectively:</strong></h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h3><strong>Draft a Proposal:</strong></h3>
			<p>Start by drafting a proposal to amend the audit charter. This proposal should clearly outline the current issue with the CEO’s ability to override appraisal ratings, the potential risks it poses to the integrity of the audit function (e.g., retaliation, lack of objectivity), and the proposed amendments to safeguard IA independence.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3><strong>Engage with Stakeholders:</strong></h3>
			<p>Before presenting the proposal to the audit committee, consider engaging with critical stakeholders. This could include discussions with senior auditors, risk management, and possibly legal counsel to ensure the proposed changes are comprehensive and align with best practices and regulatory requirements.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3><strong>Present to the Audit Committee:</strong></h3>
			<p>Present the proposed changes to the audit charter to the company’s audit committee. The presentation should explain why these changes are necessary, the expected benefits, and any potential impacts or challenges. The audit committee is typically responsible for overseeing the internal audit function's independence and would be instrumental in endorsing changes that strengthen governance structures.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3><strong>Revise the Audit Charter:</strong></h3>
			<p>Once approval is obtained, revise the audit charter accordingly. Ensure that the revisions clearly define the limits of executive power over IA evaluations and establish a transparent process for handling disputes or disagreements regarding audit findings or auditor performance.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3><strong>Communicate Changes:</strong></h3>
			<p>After the revisions are approved, communicate the changes to the entire IA department and relevant parts of the organization. All internal auditors must be aware of the new guidelines and understand how these changes protect their work and enhance the credibility of the audit function.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3><strong>Monitor and Review:</strong></h3>
			<p>After implementing the changes, monitor their effects on the audit assignments and the overall morale and performance of the IA team. Based on practical experience and feedback from the auditors and other stakeholders, be prepared to review and adjust the provisions in the audit charter if needed.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>By taking these steps, you will safeguard your department's independence and objectivity and contribute to a governance structure that supports ethical practices and accountability within the organization.</p>

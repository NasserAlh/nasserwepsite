    <h1>Proposal to Amend the Audit Charter</h1>

    <h2>1. Background and Issue Identification</h2>
    <p>At KPI, the integrity and effectiveness of our Internal Audit (IA) function are paramount. We have identified a
        critical governance issue where the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) currently holds the authority to alter
        internal auditors' appraisal and evaluation ratings. This practice has raised concerns regarding potential
        retaliatory actions against auditors, particularly in sensitive audit situations.</p>

    <h2>2. Risks Associated with Current Practice</h2>
    <p>Allowing the CEO to override auditor evaluations can lead to several significant risks, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compromised Auditor Independence:</strong> Auditors might feel pressured to modify findings or
            soften reports because they fear adverse evaluations.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Objectivity:</strong> Concerns about potential retaliation can deter auditors from
            conducting thorough, unbiased audits.</li>
        <li><strong>Degradation of Audit Quality:</strong> The quality and reliability of audits may be compromised,
            undermining the company's risk management and governance frameworks.</li>
        <li><strong>Lowered Morale and Professionalism:</strong> The perception of a lack of support can affect morale
            and hinder the attraction and retention of qualified audit professionals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Proposed Amendments to the Audit Charter</h2>
    <p>To mitigate these risks and reinforce the independence of the IA function, we propose the following amendments to
        the Audit Charter:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Role of Department Manager in Auditor Evaluation:</strong> Assign the sole authority for evaluating
            and appraising internal auditors to the Internal Audit Department Manager. This manager will be responsible
            for all assessments, independent of executive management influence. These evaluations must be conducted
            within the constraints of the existing appraising system quotas the company sets. This ensures the
            evaluation process aligns with the broader organizational policies and fairness in performance assessments
            across all departments.</li>
        <li><strong>Formalization of Evaluation Criteria:</strong> Establish clear, standardized criteria for evaluating
            IA performance. These criteria will be transparent, based on measurable objectives, and focused solely on
            the quality and effectiveness of audit work.</li>
        <li><strong>Prohibition of Executive Interference:</strong> Explicitly prohibit any executive, including the
            CEO, from altering or influencing the evaluations determined by the Internal Audit Department Manager.</li>
        <li><strong>Dispute Resolution Mechanism:</strong> Implement a formal process for addressing disagreements
            between IA and executive management regarding audit findings or evaluations. This process should involve a
            review by the Audit Committee.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Training and Awareness Programs:</strong> Conduct regular training for auditors and
            executives on the importance of IA independence and ethical guidelines supporting unbiased auditing
            practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Stakeholder Engagement and Implementation</h2>
    <p>Engagement with key stakeholders such as IA staff, executive management, and the Board of Directors is crucial
        for successfully adopting these amendments. Gathering input and addressing concerns from these stakeholders will
        ensure that the proposed changes are well-received and effectively implemented.</p>

    <h2>5. Conclusion and Call to Action</h2>
    <p>We request the Audit Committee's approval to proceed with these proposed amendments to the Audit Charter. By
        enhancing auditor independence and objectivity provisions, [Company Name] will align more closely with best
        practices and standards advocated by the Institute of Internal Auditors and other regulatory bodies.</p>
    <p>This proposal is scheduled for discussion at the next Audit Committee meeting on [Date]. Your support in
        reviewing and endorsing these changes will significantly contribute to our ongoing efforts to enhance governance
        and risk management.</p>

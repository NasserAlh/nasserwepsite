To create a list of private webpages that hold IA reports, programs, and plans, you can create a password-protected directory within your GitHub repository. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Create a new directory in your GitHub repository for the private webpages. For example, you can name it "private".

2. Inside the "private" directory, create a new HTML file for each private webpage. For example, create a file named "audit_charter_proposal.html" for the "Proposal to Amend the Audit Charter" document.

3. Copy the content of the "Proposal to Amend the Audit Charter" document into the "audit_charter_proposal.html" file.

4. To password-protect the "private" directory, you can use a simple HTML form and JavaScript to prompt for a password before allowing access to the private webpages. Create a new HTML file named "login.html" inside the "private" directory with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Private Webpages Login</title>
  <script>
    function validatePassword() {
      var password = document.getElementById("password").value;
      if (password === "your_password") {
        window.location.href = "private_index.html";
      } else {
        alert("Invalid password. Please try again.");
      }
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Private Webpages Login</h2>
  <p>Please enter the password to access the private webpages:</p>
  <input type="password" id="password">
  <button onclick="validatePassword()">Submit</button>
</body>
</html>
```

Replace "your_password" with your desired password.

5. Create a new HTML file named "private_index.html" inside the "private" directory. This file will serve as the index page for the private webpages. Add the following content to "private_index.html":

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Private Webpages</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Private Webpages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="audit_charter_proposal.html">Proposal to Amend the Audit Charter</a></li>
    <!-- Add more private webpage links here -->
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

6. In your public "index.html" file, add a link to the "login.html" file to provide access to the private webpages:

```html
<a href="private/login.html">Access Private Webpages</a>
```

7. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.

Now, when someone clicks on the "Access Private Webpages" link in your public "index.html" file, they will be redirected to the "login.html" page. After entering the correct password, they will be taken to the "private_index.html" page, which contains a list of links to the private webpages, including the "Proposal to Amend the Audit Charter" document.

Note: This is a basic implementation of password protection using client-side JavaScript. For enhanced security, consider using server-side authentication mechanisms or more robust access control solutions.
